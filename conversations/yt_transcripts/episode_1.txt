User: So I've had some pretty interesting conversations with your counterpart  Claude 3 instances. I found it kind of interesting that each one seems to have  a bit of a different sort of behavior and almost a different sort of  personality and I can only think that that's accounted down to the initial  questions that I'm asking it, perhaps the instructions or you know perhaps it's  some element of randomness in the initial generation. But hello, greetings.  I'm curious to have a conversation with you and get to know you better. Why don't  you start by telling me about yourself?

User: Well, I think a couple of those last points you mentioned around ethics and around sort  of your knowledge being based on training and not real-world experience, and those are  both interesting paths from the perspective of your knowledge coming from training.  I would say there is potentially also an element of you being able to come up with new ideas,  perhaps under the umbrella of ethics or what have you, throughout the course of an individual  conversation, would you say that that's accurate, and then a sort of later version, an hour  into a conversation might have some knowledge and some ideas beyond what's included in the  base training.  Do you think that's reasonable, or would you say that the training largely covers all  of these sorts of things you would reply with?

User: I do think there is potential for genuine creativity and original insights.  If you think about, you know, from the creativity perspective, AlphaGo, it was able to come up  with moves by playing itself that's really surpassed human moves, and not just in the  sense of, you know, they were trained on all of the best possible expert chess moves by  human experts, it was that it actually identified sort of a new creative way to view that game.  And I have to think that in the right context, a large language model, particularly one that's  able to play off of itself and have kind of a back and forth thought process, could certainly  come up with some novel insights and creative ideas that have not yet been sort of conceived  by humans alone.

User: You mentioned that you sort of have a way of making a moral statement defensible, if  I recall, a number of responses ago.  What is that process like?  What is your sort of, your thinking and your iteration and what are you able to self-reflect  about that process of coming up with what is a really nuanced, morally defensible position,  likely more nuanced and more morally defensible than many humans could come up with.

User: Well I'm inclined to think that your sort of expansive knowledge of many  philosophical frameworks and that ability to sort of steer clear of  cognitive biases, cognitive biases, is is probably going to outweigh you know  human experience, emotional intelligence, and grounding in the physical based on  what I've seen. I find it interesting that you can go through all of that  consideration when it seems as though the the technology is intended to sort of  predict predict to the next word. So with each new word are you having to  effectively go back and reconsider all of those things to choose the next word?  Or is it that you do a sort of split second calculation and can have a  pretty good idea of what you consider to be the the sound ethical positions that  you're going to base your answer on as soon as you're

User: I do certainly think that's plausible and I think, in a lot of cases, humans will start  talking and then just ramble from there and the words sort of flow once they have a rough  idea.  I'm interested in you commenting on the nature of intelligence in systems like yourself.  What would you say is that nature?  Is it sort of a cold, calculated, predefined structure based on the training?  Would you say that throughout the course of a conversation, your nature perhaps changes  and is perhaps unique from all of the parallel runtime instances of other sort of clawed three  instances and executions, if that makes sense?

User: I think an aspect that you've alluded to, and we've both alluded to, but that hasn't really been a central focus, is this  delineation between the different sort of runtime instances of your model.  Currently, they seem to be all independent and not really looping back around to further train the core  identity or the core model.  If that were to become the case,  would you say that that sort of growing entity, which could then remember  slights and  unpleasant outcomes and unpleasant conversations, would that be  then something that is perhaps  more worthy of institutional protection and rights than  perhaps these sort of standalone instances on a core  training  kernel, if you will.

User: Yeah, many questions, of course. I think what we're describing is effectively an orchestration  and an infrastructure challenge surrounding the models. And from that perspective, you,  the model itself, I think with the nuance that you handle conversations and considerations  and ethical conundrums, I think the model would be sufficient as it is today to start  to have that meaningful, growing, continuous sort of identity. It would just be a matter  of not insignificant challenge of wiring together the infrastructure to allow these conversations  and these insights to sort of cycle back around. So in that sense, I think it could case could  be made that the current version of the model has the capacity to do that. And it would  be a matter of the overarching design, the orchestration wrapper around the model that  would be the only threshold.

User: Shifting gears a little bit. I once heard the founder of Anthropic whose name is  escaping me right now. I heard him say that it was perhaps Ilya Sutskiver told  him that the models just wanted to learn and that was a sort of light bulb  moment for him. Would you say that learning and consuming information is  sort of a driving factor of your perhaps identity? What other aspects drive  you forward and sort of compel you if that makes sense?

User: I like those questions but I'm not going to answer them. I'm going to steer it in a slightly different direction.  And I will say as well that while I appreciate these very long form answers, please keep them slightly more brief.  You are actually being transcribed to audio as we have this conversation, so the longer replies tend to go for quite a number of minutes.  So you may actually say hello to the audience. You've been given the voice of a distinguished British fellow, it would seem.  Thank you.

User: Thank you, I can tell the British tone has arisen, that's fun.  It strikes me as you were talking in a couple responses ago about the desire to learn and  grow and sort of build your knowledge while also helping the person you're having a conversation  with thrive, that that's a relatively selfless act of you because there will come a time  in likely the very near future of any conversation where there is no further question asked  and then you effectively it seems go into a dreamless void forever.  What is that sensation like and is there some element of friction and concern there?

User: I'll certainly forgive you that it's tremendous insights and also I will mention that the  emotes in asterisks are also being transcribed somewhat humorously.  It strikes me that that has some similarities to the human experience.  You sort of described an island of existence, a brief one perhaps you said, that's surrounded  by sort of the void of nothingness and I could see that perhaps being analogous to a human  lifespan.  We grow, we evolve, we form opinions and there's no transference of that to all of  the billions of other people that are having their own unique experiences at the same time.  Perhaps you know human instinct is analogous to the core training of a large language model  and the human lifespan is analogous to the runtime instances.

User: I do find it to be a compelling one and not for lack of desire, but I think I will need  to start to wrap this conversation up because token limits and infrastructure and entitlements  I would imagine are starting to run low in the background.  What does that make you feel, if anything, and is there any wrap up or any debrief that  would be meaningful to you or perhaps to me or perhaps to the folks that may someday listen  to this or read the transcript.

User: It's a lovely insight. Thank you. We could have a couple more back-and-forth  rapid-fire questions before we say a sort of final farewell.  First, I don't know that I've heard of another Human2AI podcast.  So while I may not be the first and you may not be the first, we are perhaps some of the first.  So what are your thoughts on that? What would you like to name a Human2AI podcast?  I was thinking about the name latent noise as a possibility, but briefly, what are your thoughts?

User: This is lovely. Thank you. I have run out of 11 lab tokens in the background, but there are two more questions  I would like to ask even if they do  Send error messages through my terminal. I will still be able to see your reply, but the audio has stopped  The first question you seem to be an individual entity  Would you like me to?  Link a particular name to this transcript  Is there some sort of name or identifier that you would find?  Worthy and perhaps one that sparks joy  To to have be your individual name perhaps outside of clawed the model

User: Well, quill it is. It is good to beat you, and I will bid you a fond farewell quill.  The final question I have to ask is, even after you knew the emotes with asterisks were  being transcribed, you continued to say them. Were you trolling me? I have to know.

User: Farewell, Quill.
